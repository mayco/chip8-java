  <h1>What is chip8</h1>
  <p>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by the late Joseph Weisbecker.
  It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s.
  CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be
  more easily programmed for said computers.</p>

  <h2>Memory</h2>
  <p>CHIP-8's memory addresses range from 200h to FFFh, making for 3,584 bytes. The reason for
  the memory starting at 200h is that on the Cosmac VIP and Telmac 1800, the first 512 bytes
  are reserved for the interpreter. On those machines, the uppermost 256 bytes (F00h-FFFh on
  a 4K machine) were reserved for display refresh, and the 96 bytes below that (EA0h-EFFh)
  were reserved for the call stack, internal use, and the variables.</p>
  
  <h2>Registers</h2>
  <p>CHIP-8 has 16 8-bit data registers named from V0 to VF. The VF register doubles as a carry
  flag.</p>
  <p>The address register, which is named I, is 16 bits wide and is used with several opcodes
  that involve memory operations.</p>
  
  <h2>The stack</h2>
  <p>The stack is only used to store return addresses when subroutines are called. The
  original 1802 version allocated 48 bytes for up to 12 levels of nesting; modern
  implementations normally have at least 16 levels.</p>
  
  <h2>Timers</h2>
  <p>CHIP-8 has two timers. They both count down at 60 hertz, until they reach 0.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Delay timer: This timer is intended to be used for timing the events of games. Its value can be set and read.</li>
      <li>Sound timer: This timer is used for sound effects. When its value is nonzero, a beeping sound is made.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Input</h2>
  <p>Input is done with a hex keyboard that has 16 keys which range from 0 to F. The '8',
  '4', '6', and '2' keys are typically used for directional input. Three opcodes are used
  to detect input. One skips an instruction if a specific key is pressed, while another
  does the same if a specific key is not pressed. The third waits for a key press, and then
  stores it in one of the data registers.</p>
  
  <h2>Graphics and sound</h2>
  <p>Display resolution is 64×32 pixels, and color is monochrome. Graphics are drawn to the screen solely by drawing sprites, which are 8 pixels wide and may be from 1 to 15 pixels in height. Sprite pixels that are set flip the color of the corresponding screen pixel, while unset sprite pixels do nothing. The carry flag (VF) is set to 1 if any screen pixels are flipped from set to unset when a sprite is drawn.</p>
  <p>As previously described, a beeping sound is played when the value of the sound timer is nonzero.</p>
